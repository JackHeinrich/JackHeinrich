## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I just finished developing my first web app RespawnRecord! (https://respawnrecordv2-frontend.onrender.com/)

(It may take a while to load because I can only afford free hosting ðŸ˜”)

It's a web app similar to Letterboxxed but for tracking games you, and others have played.

It uses Next.js and React frameworks for the frontend and the backend is an Express API.

I use Auth0's user metadata as a sort of database and get all the game data from the IGDB API.

I hope you like it :D
